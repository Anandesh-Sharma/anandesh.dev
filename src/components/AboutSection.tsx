            I'm a passionate frontend developer with a keen eye for design and a love for creating seamless user experiences. 
            My journey in web development began several years ago, and I've been hooked ever since.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            I specialize in modern JavaScript frameworks like React, and I pride myself on writing clean, maintainable code 
            that delivers exceptional user experiences. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, 
            contributing to open-source projects, or enjoying the outdoors.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations. If you think we could work together on something great, 
            don't hesitate to reach out.
